Here are some random python programs

A little story to them:

When I was in eighth grade, I was in the coding club of my school. Not to brag but everyone was busy making calculator or average calculation programs. I loved coding by heart so I was way ahead. Our teacher recognized this skill of mine and gave me some relatively harder programs. These were also preety easy but still they gave confidence to me. Thus, I wanted to share them.

Some of the other programs are from my test dome examination. These 2 helped me to get my gold certificate. There are also some other AI testing files of mine.

Thanks.
